# Senior-Project

Implemented the forward pass algorithm for a machine learning model.

# Project Usage

1. Train the AI model in python and ouput the model to a .h5 file.
2. Run the python script in the File_Creation folder to change the .h5 file to a .lit file to make it easier to parse.
3. Take the .lit file along with the mnist data set in the samples folder and run it using the File_Parsing_library to find the accuracy.

# Project Structure

- The C++ Neural network library is in the NerualNetLibrary and File_Parsing_library folder.
- The C++ MNIST Data set reader is in the MNIST_Reader folder.
- The model creation and testing in python is in the Model_Tests and Model_Creation folder.
- The python file format changer is in the File_Creation folder
